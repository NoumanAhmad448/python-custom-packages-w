# Custom Python Packages to ease your development
Our purpose is to make development easy for you so that you can focus on usage rather than building
your logic

## Usage 
- Each folder is a package.
- Folder contains a **_cls.py** file(at-least one). You need to copy and paste it in your project.
- All other files with simple .py extensions are created either for testing purpose or for some other reason. 
- Folder contains a **.md** file which is used for documentation purpose
- For time being, we are only focusing on most commonly used functions/methods
